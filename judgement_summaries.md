## Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Shreeji Earth Movers

Summary: The case involves Shreeji Earth Movers, a proprietary firm,
which sought clarification from the Gujarat Appellate Authority for
Advance Ruling (AAAR) regarding the applicability of Goods and Services
Tax (GST) on their services. The firm provides services such as
excavation, transportation, and loading of soil and earth material. The
primary question raised in the appeal was whether these services, when
provided for government contracts, would fall under the exemption
category of \"pure services\" under GST.

The AAAR evaluated the nature of the services and whether the
appellant\'s activities could be considered as \"pure services\"
provided to a government entity. The ruling highlighted various
provisions and earlier rulings to determine the correct tax treatment.
The authority noted that the exemption under GST applies to services
that are purely non-commercial in nature and directly benefit the
government.

Upon careful examination, the authority concluded that the activities
performed by Shreeji Earth Movers could not be classified as \"pure
services,\" as they involve the supply of goods as part of their service
contracts. Thus, the AAAR ruled that the services are taxable under the
relevant GST provisions.

This ruling provides clarity on the GST applicability for contractors
engaging in infrastructure-related activities involving mixed supplies
of goods and services, ensuring compliance with tax laws.

## Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Sankalp Facilities and Management Services). 

Summary: Sankalp Facilities and Management Services, a private limited
company, approached the Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling
(AAAR) to seek clarity on the GST implications for their services. The
company provides various facility management services, including
housekeeping, manpower supply, and maintenance services, primarily to
corporate and commercial entities.

The key issue raised in the appeal was whether their services would be
considered as composite supplies under GST or whether they should be
taxed as individual services. The company argued that their offerings
are bundled as facility management services, which should attract a
lower tax rate when provided as a whole rather than individually.

The AAAR carefully examined the nature of the services provided by the
appellant. The ruling delved into the definitions of composite and mixed
supplies under GST law, emphasizing that for a service to qualify as
composite, all components must be naturally bundled and supplied in
conjunction with one another in the ordinary course of business.

Upon review, the authority concluded that the services provided by
Sankalp Facilities and Management Services could not be classified as
composite supplies, as each service (e.g., housekeeping, manpower
supply) is distinct and can be provided separately. As such, these
services are liable to be taxed individually based on their respective
tax rates under GST.

This ruling helps clarify the tax treatment of bundled services,
especially for businesses involved in facility management, ensuring that
services provided separately are taxed accordingly.

## Sri Venkateswara Cashew Chikky Manufacturers Ruling. 

Summary: Sri Venkateswara Cashew Chikky Manufacturers, a manufacturer of
cashew-based products, approached the Appellate Authority for Advance
Ruling (AAAR) in Andhra Pradesh seeking clarification regarding the tax
classification of their products under Goods and Services Tax (GST). The
key question was whether their products---specifically cashew chikkis
and other cashew-based snacks---could be classified under the lower GST
slab applicable to food products, or whether they fell under a higher
tax category due to their processed nature.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions of the appellant and studied the
applicable sections of the GST Act concerning food items and processed
goods. The appellant argued that their products should be classified
under the food category, which attracts a reduced GST rate, as they are
made from natural ingredients like cashews and sugar without the
addition of preservatives or artificial ingredients.

After careful examination, the authority ruled that cashew chikkis and
similar products are processed foods and therefore do not qualify for
the lower tax rate applicable to unprocessed or minimally processed
foods. The authority cited precedents and GST classification rules to
emphasize that the manufacturing process, which involves significant
alteration of raw cashews, places the products in a higher tax bracket.

This ruling clarifies the GST treatment for manufacturers of processed
snacks, helping businesses understand the tax implications of their
product classification under GST, ensuring compliance with the law.

Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Worley Services
India Pvt. Ltd.). Summary: Worley Services India Pvt. Ltd., a company
providing engineering, project management, and consulting services,
approached the Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR)
seeking clarification on the applicability of Goods and Services Tax
(GST) on services provided to overseas clients. The company argued that
the services should qualify as \"export of services,\" making them
zero-rated under GST.

The central issue addressed by the AAAR was whether the services
provided by Worley Services, which were primarily delivered to clients
outside India but involved some domestic activities, could be classified
as exports under GST law. The appellant contended that since the
services benefited overseas clients and payments were received in
foreign currency, they should be treated as export services.

The AAAR examined the conditions necessary for a service to qualify as
an export under GST, including the place of supply, the recipient of the
service, and whether the consideration is received in convertible
foreign exchange. Upon review, the authority concluded that the services
provided by Worley Services do not meet all the criteria for export
services, particularly because certain activities were performed within
India and directly benefited Indian clients.

As a result, the AAAR ruled that the services provided by the appellant
are not zero-rated and are subject to GST under the relevant provisions.
This ruling provides guidance for companies involved in cross-border
service transactions, clarifying when services qualify as exports and
when they attract GST.

Uttar Pradesh Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Uttar Pradesh
Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.). Summary: Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail
Corporation Ltd. (UPMRC), a public-sector undertaking involved in the
development and operation of metro rail services in the state, sought
clarity from the Uttar Pradesh Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling
(AAAR) on the applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on several
services related to metro projects.

The core issue raised by UPMRC was whether services such as civil
construction, electrical installation, and engineering contracts, which
were being provided by contractors for metro rail projects, could be
exempt from GST under the provisions related to government contracts.
The appellant argued that metro services are an essential part of public
transport infrastructure and, therefore, should qualify for tax
exemptions applicable to government services.

The AAAR carefully analyzed the provisions of the GST Act, particularly
in the context of services provided for government-approved projects and
infrastructure development. After considering the arguments, the AAAR
concluded that while metro services themselves may be exempt from GST,
the ancillary services provided by contractors, including construction
and electrical work, do not qualify for such an exemption. These
services are commercial in nature and provided by private contractors,
making them taxable under the GST regime.

This ruling provides clarity on the tax treatment of services related to
infrastructure projects, emphasizing that while core public services may
receive exemptions, the ancillary services provided by private entities
remain taxable under GST.

Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Adama India Pvt. Ltd.).

Summary: Adama India Pvt. Ltd., a chemical manufacturing company, sought
clarification from the Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling
(AAAR) on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implications related to their
operations. The key issue raised was whether GST is applicable on
certain chemical intermediaries and whether the input tax credit could
be claimed on goods used for the manufacture of these intermediaries.

The appellant argued that the chemical intermediaries they produce are
essential components in the production of agricultural pesticides and
other products that benefit from tax exemptions under GST. They
contended that their products should either be exempt from GST or taxed
at a lower rate, given their role in agriculture-related activities.
Additionally, the company sought clarity on whether the input tax credit
on materials and equipment used in the manufacturing process could be
claimed.

The AAAR analyzed the nature of the products and their role in the
manufacturing chain. After examining the applicable tax provisions, the
authority concluded that the chemical intermediaries produced by Adama
India Pvt. Ltd. do not qualify for a GST exemption as they are not
directly used in agricultural activities but rather in further
industrial processes. As such, the products are taxable under GST.

Regarding the input tax credit, the authority confirmed that Adama India
Pvt. Ltd. is entitled to claim input tax credit on goods and services
used in their manufacturing process, provided the products are used in
taxable supplies.

This ruling clarifies the tax treatment of chemical intermediaries and
the conditions for claiming input tax credits under GST, ensuring
compliance for manufacturers in similar sectors.

Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Monalisa
Co-Operative Housing Society Limited). Summary: Monalisa Co-Operative
Housing Society Limited, located in Maharashtra, sought clarification
from the Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR)
regarding the applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on various
services provided by the housing society to its members. The primary
question raised was whether the maintenance services, collection of
membership fees, and other charges levied by the society fall under the
purview of GST.

The housing society argued that the services provided to its members,
such as maintenance of common areas, security, and other amenities,
should be exempt from GST as they are not provided for commercial
purposes but rather to ensure the upkeep of the residential premises.
They further argued that any contributions collected from members for
maintenance purposes should not be treated as taxable services.

The AAAR reviewed the relevant sections of the GST Act, focusing on the
provisions related to services provided by cooperative societies and
residential communities. The authority noted that although the services
are provided for the benefit of society members, they fall under the
definition of taxable services when the total value of services provided
exceeds a specified threshold.

The AAAR ruled that Monalisa Co-Operative Housing Society is liable to
pay GST on the services provided to its members, as they constitute
taxable services under GST law. However, small-scale services below the
threshold may be exempted.

This ruling provides clarity for housing societies regarding the
applicability of GST on the maintenance and other services provided to
members, helping them comply with the necessary tax provisions.

## Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (CHEP India Pvt. Ltd.). 

Summary: CHEP India Pvt. Ltd., a logistics and supply chain company,
approached the Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR)
seeking clarification on the applicability of Goods and Services Tax
(GST) on their asset pooling services. The company\'s business model
involves leasing reusable pallets and containers to clients for use in
transporting goods. The question raised was whether GST applies to the
leasing of these assets and whether it qualifies for any exemptions
under the GST regime.

The company argued that the reusable pallets and containers are part of
an eco-friendly initiative and are provided to clients for logistics and
transportation purposes. They claimed that these assets should be
classified under a lower GST rate or considered exempt from GST, as they
are not standard goods or services but instead part of a service that
reduces environmental impact by promoting sustainability.

The AAAR evaluated the nature of the company\'s services and their
classification under GST law. After reviewing the relevant legal
provisions, the authority concluded that the leasing of pallets and
containers qualifies as a taxable supply of services under the GST Act.
As such, the company must charge GST at the applicable rate on these
services. The ruling clarified that no specific exemption or reduction
in GST rate applies to such services, despite their environmental
benefits.

This decision provides clarity for logistics and supply chain companies
on the taxability of asset pooling and leasing services, ensuring
compliance with GST law for similar service providers.

Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Rajkot Nagarik Sahakari
Bank Ltd.). Summary: Rajkot Nagarik Sahakari Bank Ltd., a cooperative
bank, approached the Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling
(AAAR) seeking clarification on the applicability of Goods and Services
Tax (GST) on certain services provided by the bank. The key issue raised
was whether the services rendered by the bank, including loan
processing, management fees, and other banking-related services, fall
under the purview of GST.

The bank contended that being a cooperative institution, the services
provided to its members, especially in terms of loan management, should
be exempt from GST as they are offered in a non-commercial capacity.
They argued that the bank operates with the primary objective of serving
its members, making its services non-taxable under GST provisions.

The AAAR reviewed the arguments put forth by the appellant and examined
the relevant provisions of the GST Act. The authority highlighted that
even though the bank operates as a cooperative society, the services
provided---such as loan processing and management---are still classified
as taxable services under GST, irrespective of the cooperative
structure. The ruling emphasized that cooperative banks offering
financial services to their members are subject to GST on par with
commercial banks.

Consequently, the AAAR ruled that Rajkot Nagarik Sahakari Bank Ltd. is
liable to charge GST on the services provided to its members, including
loan processing and other financial services.

This ruling clarifies the taxability of cooperative banking services
under GST, ensuring that cooperative banks adhere to the same tax
regulations as commercial banking entities.

Uttar Pradesh Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Indian Hume Pipe
Company Ltd.).

Summary: Indian Hume Pipe Company Ltd., a manufacturer of pipes and
infrastructure solutions, approached the Uttar Pradesh Appellate
Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) seeking clarification on the
applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on certain supply
contracts. The key issue raised was whether the supply of pre-stressed
concrete pipes for water supply projects undertaken by the government
would be eligible for GST exemptions.

The company argued that the pipes supplied were specifically for
government-approved projects aimed at providing water infrastructure,
and as such, they should be exempt from GST under provisions related to
government projects and public welfare schemes. The appellant
highlighted that the supply of goods for government projects related to
essential services, such as water supply, should attract a lower GST
rate or qualify for exemptions.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and analyzed the provisions of the GST
Act concerning supplies made for government-approved projects. Upon
review, the authority concluded that while the projects are for public
welfare, the goods supplied by Indian Hume Pipe Company Ltd. are
classified as taxable supplies under the GST framework. The ruling
emphasized that the mere involvement of government projects does not
exempt suppliers from GST, and the specific nature of the goods supplied
(pipes, in this case) does not qualify for exemption.

As a result, the AAAR ruled that the supply of pipes for water supply
projects is subject to GST at the applicable rate.

This ruling provides clarity for suppliers involved in government
infrastructure projects, ensuring that goods provided for such projects
comply with GST regulations.

## Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (The Varachha Co-op. Bank Ltd.).

Summary: The Varachha Co-operative Bank Ltd. sought clarification from
the Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) on the
applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) to banking services
provided to its members. The central issue was whether the services
provided by the bank to its members, including loan processing,
deposits, and other financial services, attract GST.

The bank argued that being a cooperative institution, the services
rendered to its members are not intended for commercial profit, and
thus, these services should be exempt from GST. They further contended
that cooperative societies, which are member-owned, should receive a
different tax treatment compared to commercial banks.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and analyzed the relevant provisions
under the GST law. The authority highlighted that cooperative societies,
while member-driven, still provide taxable services if those services
fall under the purview of financial transactions. The authority
concluded that financial services such as loan processing, management
fees, and interest charges are taxable under GST even if they are
offered by a cooperative bank.

The AAAR ruled that The Varachha Co-operative Bank Ltd. is liable to
charge GST on all the financial services provided to its members,
ensuring that they comply with GST laws applicable to financial
institutions.

This ruling reinforces the tax treatment of cooperative banking
services, ensuring that cooperative banks follow the same GST
regulations as other financial institutions.

## *Uttar Pradesh Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited)*. 

Summary: Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), a
government-owned power distribution company, approached the Uttar
Pradesh Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) to seek
clarification on the applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on
certain services related to electricity distribution and infrastructure
development. The key issue was whether the company is liable to pay GST
on charges related to the development of electrical infrastructure for
providing power supply to consumers.

The appellant argued that as a government entity engaged in essential
public utility services, they should be exempt from GST on such charges.
They contended that these services are not commercial in nature and are
crucial for the provision of basic utilities like electricity.

The AAAR reviewed the relevant provisions of the GST Act concerning
electricity distribution and government services. The authority
acknowledged that electricity supply itself is exempt from GST; however,
they clarified that services related to infrastructure
development---such as the creation of substations, laying power lines,
and other associated work---do not qualify for GST exemption. These
activities are considered commercial services under the GST framework
and are thus taxable.

The ruling concluded that Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited is
liable to charge GST on all infrastructure development services provided
to customers, even though the electricity supply itself remains exempt.

This ruling helps clarify the taxability of services related to public
utilities, ensuring that companies providing essential infrastructure

## Punjab Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Bansal Industries). 

Summary: Bansal Industries, a manufacturer based in Punjab, approached
the Punjab Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) to seek
clarification on the applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on
certain agricultural equipment manufactured and sold by the company. The
primary issue raised in the appeal was whether their products, which
include agricultural implements like plows and tillers, qualify for a
lower GST rate applicable to agricultural equipment or are subject to
the standard GST rate.

The appellant argued that their products are directly used in
agricultural activities and therefore should be classified under the
agricultural equipment category, which enjoys a lower GST rate. Bansal
Industries emphasized that the products are essential for small farmers
and contribute significantly to agriculture, justifying the lower tax
rate.

The AAAR examined the classification of the products under the GST Act
and considered the appellant\'s arguments. The authority noted that
while agricultural implements are generally taxed at a lower rate, the
specific classification of the products in question must align with the
Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) code to qualify for the reduced
rate. Upon review, the AAAR determined that certain products
manufactured by Bansal Industries did not meet the criteria for the
lower GST rate and are subject to the standard rate of tax.

The ruling clarified the GST classification of agricultural implements
and the importance of proper product categorization to determine
applicable tax rates, ensuring manufacturers comply with GST
regulations.

Environmental R&D Pvt. Ltd.).

Summary: IVL India Environmental R&D Pvt. Ltd., a company involved in
environmental research and development services, sought clarification
from the Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) on
the applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for services provided
in connection with environmental testing and compliance. The key issue
was whether the services provided by the company qualify for exemption
from GST under the provisions related to scientific and technical
research.

The company argued that their services, which involve testing and
analyzing environmental factors such as air and water quality, are
scientific in nature and should be exempt from GST as per the provisions
for research services. They further contended that their services
contribute to the public good by aiding environmental compliance and
safeguarding natural resources.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and analyzed the applicable GST
provisions concerning scientific and technical research. The authority
noted that while the company provides research services, the specific
nature of the services---such as environmental testing and
reporting---falls under taxable services as per the GST Act. The AAAR
clarified that the services provided by IVL India Environmental R&D Pvt.
Ltd. do not qualify for exemption and are subject to GST at the
applicable rate.

The ruling concluded that the company\'s services are taxable, ensuring
that research and testing companies operating in the environmental
sector adhere to the GST provisions.

## Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Puranik Builders Ltd.). 

Summary: Puranik Builders Ltd., a real estate development company,
approached the Maharashtra Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR)
seeking clarification on the applicability of Goods and Services Tax
(GST) on development rights transferred to other entities for real
estate projects. The primary issue raised in the appeal was whether GST
is applicable on the transfer of such development rights, and if so,
what the applicable tax rate would be.

The company contended that development rights represent intangible
assets, and their transfer should either be exempt from GST or be
subject to a lower tax rate. Puranik Builders argued that since the
transfer of development rights does not involve the supply of tangible
goods or services, it should be treated as a special case under GST law.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and analyzed the provisions of the GST
Act related to the transfer of development rights. The authority
clarified that the transfer of development rights constitutes a taxable
supply under GST, as it is treated as a service. The AAAR ruled that GST
is applicable on the transfer of such rights, with the applicable rate
depending on the nature of the project for which the rights are being
transferred (e.g., residential or commercial).

This ruling provides real estate developers with clarity on the
taxability of development rights under GST, ensuring that such
transactions comply with tax regulations in the construction and
development sectors.

Summary: IDMC Ltd., a company involved in the manufacturing of dairy
equipment and related machinery, sought clarification from the Gujarat
Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) regarding the
applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on certain supplies made
to the dairy sector. The key question raised was whether the sale of
dairy equipment to cooperative societies engaged in milk production and
distribution is exempt from GST or subject to the standard GST rate.

The company argued that their equipment is essential for dairy
production and should be classified under agricultural machinery, which
would qualify for a lower GST rate or exemption. They contended that
since their customers are cooperative societies engaged in agricultural
activities, the equipment should receive favorable tax treatment.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and considered the relevant provisions
of the GST Act regarding agricultural equipment and its classification.
The authority concluded that while the equipment supplied by IDMC Ltd.
is used in dairy production, it does not fall under the category of
agricultural machinery as defined under GST law. Therefore, the
equipment is subject to the standard GST rate applicable to industrial
machinery.

The ruling clarified that the sale of dairy equipment is not exempt from
GST, even when sold to cooperative societies involved in agriculture.
This decision helps manufacturers and suppliers in the dairy industry
understand the tax implications of their products under GST regulations.

NBCC India Ltd. contended that the services they provide, particularly
for housing projects, are public-oriented and should either be exempt

qualify for special tax treatment under the GST regime.

The AAAR analyzed the submissions and reviewed the relevant provisions
of the GST Act, which outline the treatment of services related to
construction and infrastructure. The authority concluded that while
certain government services are exempt from GST, construction services
provided by NBCC India Ltd. do not qualify for the exemption. The AAAR

This ruling provides clear guidance to government contractors and real
estate developers working on public projects, confirming that

clarification on the applicability of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on
the sale of certain electronic goods. The main question raised was
whether their products---specifically computer peripherals and
electronic accessories---are subject to a lower GST rate or fall under
the standard tax bracket.

The company contended that their products, which include essential
electronic components, should be classified under the GST category for
information technology (IT) equipment, which benefits from a lower GST
rate. MEK Peripherals argued that since their products are integral to
the functioning of computers and other IT systems, they should qualify
for reduced tax treatment under GST law.

The AAAR examined the classification of the products in question and
considered the relevant provisions of the GST Act. The authority
concluded that while the products are indeed used in IT systems, they do
not specifically fall under the category of IT equipment as defined by

Services Tax (GST) on the sale of certain commodities. The main issue
was whether specific goods sold by the appellant, including certain
agricultural produce and processed items, qualified for exemption from
GST or were subject to the standard tax rate.

Pandey Traders argued that some of their products, particularly those
related to agriculture, should be classified under exempt categories.
They contended that since their products were minimally processed and
retained their agricultural characteristics, they should be exempt from
GST.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and the relevant GST provisions,
focusing on the classification of agricultural products and processed
goods. The authority clarified that while unprocessed agricultural
produce is exempt from GST, processed items do not qualify for the
exemption. The ruling emphasized that even minimal processing could
change the taxability of goods under the GST regime.

The AAAR concluded that Pandey Traders is liable to charge GST on the
sale of processed agricultural goods, as they no longer qualify as
exempt products. This decision provides clarity on the classification
and taxation of agricultural products, helping traders and businesses

Order).

Summary: Coral Manufacturing, a company involved in producing and
selling industrial machinery, approached the Tamil Nadu Appellate
Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) to seek clarification on the Goods
and Services Tax (GST) applicability for certain goods sold under
industrial use. The key issue was whether the machinery and equipment
manufactured by the company qualify for a reduced GST rate as capital
goods or are subject to the standard tax rate applicable to industrial
machinery.

The appellant argued that their products, being integral to industrial
operations, should be classified as capital goods, which could
potentially qualify for a lower GST rate. They emphasized that the
equipment was designed for specific industrial applications and was used
in manufacturing processes, justifying a more favorable tax treatment.

The AAAR carefully examined the submissions and reviewed the applicable
provisions under the GST Act. After consideration, the authority ruled
that the machinery and equipment sold by Coral Manufacturing are subject
to the standard GST rate for industrial machinery. The AAAR clarified
that the classification as capital goods does not automatically result

ensuring compliance with GST regulations applicable to capital goods.

## *Punjab Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (Punjab State Power Corporation Limited - PSPCL)*. 

Summary: Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), a
government-owned power distribution company, approached the Punjab
Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) seeking clarity on the
Goods and Services Tax (GST) applicability for services related to
electricity transmission and distribution. The key issue raised was
whether the services provided by PSPCL to its customers---especially
electricity transmission and infrastructure development---should be
exempt from GST, as electricity supply itself is GST-exempt.

PSPCL argued that since electricity is a public utility and is exempt
from GST, the ancillary services required for its transmission and
distribution should also be exempt. They contended that these services
are an integral part of providing electricity, and as a government
entity, they should not be subject to additional tax burdens.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and relevant GST provisions concerning
electricity supply and the services related to it. While the supply of
electricity itself is exempt from GST, the authority clarified that
ancillary services, such as infrastructure development for transmission,
are not exempt from GST. These services are treated as taxable under GST
law, even if provided by a government entity.

related to electricity transmission and infrastructure development. This

Summary: Beeup Skills Foundation, an organization involved in skill
development and training, approached the Maharashtra Appellate Authority

Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their services. The key issue raised was
whether the vocational training services provided by the foundation,
which aim to enhance employability and skills development, are exempt
from GST under the provisions related to educational services.

The appellant argued that since their services are aligned with the
national mission for skill development and focus on training and
capacity building for underprivileged youth, they should be exempt from
GST. They emphasized that their services contribute directly to public
welfare by providing essential skills that improve employment prospects.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and analyzed the relevant provisions
of the GST Act concerning educational and vocational training services.
The authority concluded that while educational services provided by
recognized institutions may qualify for GST exemptions, the specific
services provided by Beeup Skills Foundation do not meet the criteria
for such exemptions. The AAAR ruled that the services offered by the

category of educational services defined in the exemption list.

This ruling provides clarity for organizations involved in vocational

public transport services through the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS),
sought clarification from the Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance
Ruling (AAAR) regarding the applicability of Goods and Services Tax
(GST) on its operations. The key issue raised was whether the public
transport services provided by the company are exempt from GST under the
provisions for public transportation services.

Ahmedabad Janmarg contended that their services fall under the category
of public transportation, which is exempt from GST under the relevant
provisions of the GST Act. The appellant argued that since their
services directly benefit the public and contribute to reducing traffic
congestion and pollution, they should not be subject to GST.

The AAAR reviewed the submissions and examined the provisions of the GST
Act concerning public transportation. After considering the arguments,
the authority concluded that the services provided by Ahmedabad Janmarg
Limited are indeed public transport services and are thus exempt from
GST. The AAAR clarified that as long as the services are provided for

transportation, they will not attract GST.

their tax liabilities, confirming that services aimed at the general
public and provided through government-approved systems, such as BRTS,
