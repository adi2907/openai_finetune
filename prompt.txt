Here's an example judgement

\`\`\` M/s. Rajkot Nagarik Sahakari Bank Ltd., a cooperative bank
registered under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) with GSTIN
24AAAAR2912F1Z0, participated in the \"Atma Nirbhar Gujarat Sahay
Yojana\" launched by the Gujarat State Government. This scheme aimed to
provide unsecured loans up to â‚¹1 lakh to small traders, middle-class
businessmen, individual artisans, and the working class at an interest
rate of 8%. Under the scheme, the borrowers were required to pay only 2%
interest, while the remaining 6% was borne by the Gujarat State
Government as an interest subsidy.

In addition to the interest subsidy provided to borrowers, the State
Government offered a one-time performance-based incentive to the
participating banks and cooperative credit societies. This incentive was
calculated as a percentage of the total loans disbursed under the
scheme, with higher percentages awarded for greater loan amounts
disbursed. The incentives ranged from 2% to 4% based on the total
lending volume.

Believing that the incentives received were akin to subsidies and thus
not subject to GST, M/s. Rajkot Nagarik Sahakari Bank Ltd. sought an
advance ruling from the Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling (GAAR). The
bank posed several questions:

1.  Whether the incentives received under the \"Atma Nirbhar Gujarat
    Sahay Yojana\" could be considered as subsidies and not chargeable
    to tax.

2.  Whether these incentives could be considered as a supply of service
    under Section 7 of the CGST Act.

3.  If considered as a supply, whether they would be covered under
    Section 7(2) of the CGST Act.

4.  Whether the incentives could be excluded from the value of taxable
    supply under Section 15(2)(e) of the CGST Act.

The GAAR, in its order dated August 11, 2021, ruled that the incentives
were liable to GST. It held that the incentives were not subsidies and
did not merit exclusion from the valuation under Section 15(2)(e). The
supply was covered under Section 7(1)(a) and not under Section 7(2) of
the CGST Act.

Aggrieved by this ruling, the bank appealed to the Appellate Authority
for Advance Ruling (AAAR), reiterating its stance that the incentives
were subsidies provided by the government and should not be considered
as \'consideration\' under Section 2(31) of the CGST Act. The bank
argued that subsidies given by the Central or State Government are
explicitly excluded from the definition of consideration and thus from
the taxable value. They further contended that the incentives should not
be considered a supply under Section 7(2) and should be excluded from
the value of taxable supply under Section 15(2)(e).

The bank also referenced various legal definitions and previous rulings,
including the dictionary meanings of \'incentive\' and \'subsidy,\' and
cited cases such as Rashmi Hospitality Services Pvt. Ltd. and Ponni
Sugars and Chemicals Limited to support their argument.

The appellate authority examined the resolutions issued for the \"Atma
Nirbhar Gujarat Sahay Yojana,\" noting that the government resolutions
explicitly used two distinct terms: \'interest subsidy\' (referred to in
Gujarati as \'vyaj sahay\') for the 6% interest borne by the government
on behalf of the borrowers, and \'incentive\' for the performance-based
payments made to the banks. The authority emphasized that if the
government intended both terms to mean the same, it would not have used
different terminology in the resolutions.

The appellate authority concluded that the incentives provided to the
banks were not subsidies but were consideration for the services
rendered by the banks in disbursing loans under the scheme. It
highlighted that the incentives were performance-based and varied
depending on the total amount of loans disbursed, reinforcing that they
were rewards for services provided rather than subsidies intended for
public benefit.

Furthermore, the authority referred to Section 2(31) of the CGST Act,
which defines \'consideration\' and explicitly excludes subsidies given
by the government. However, since the incentives did not qualify as
subsidies, they were included in the taxable value as consideration for
services. The authority also addressed the bank\'s alternative
arguments:

-   The claim that the incentives could be considered \'actionable
    claims\' was rejected. The authority explained that \'actionable
    claims\' refer to unsecured debts or beneficial interests in movable
    property not in possession of the claimant, which did not apply to
    the performance-based incentives received by the bank.

-   The argument that the incentives were compensation towards interest
    was also dismissed. The authority noted that there was no
    substantiated evidence to show that the incentives were meant to
    compensate for lower interest rates charged by the banks.

The authority cited the Supreme Court judgment in the case of *Dilip
Kumar & Company* to emphasize that exemption notifications should be
interpreted strictly, and any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of
revenue. It stated that unless the law clearly exempts certain payments
from GST, they should be considered taxable.

In conclusion, the appellate authority upheld the GAAR\'s ruling,
rejecting the appeal filed by M/s. Rajkot Nagarik Sahakari Bank Ltd. It
affirmed that the incentives received under the \"Atma Nirbhar Gujarat
Sahay Yojana\" were taxable under the CGST Act as consideration for
services provided by the bank and did not qualify as subsidies exempt
from GST.
